CS 382-001 Project 2 : Joe Cisler and Nure Sabri

In this mission demolition project, we constructed a game in which you launch a ball at a building and attempt to hit the goal. For ours, we have given the user 5 attempts per round, and once this is exceeded, you see a game over screen with a play again button that takes the user back to the start. 

We included a band for the ball which retracts as the ball is pulled back, and we included an audio effect for the ball as it glides through the air and stops when it is done moving. 

There are 6 levels in total, the original 2 as well as 4 unique levels which increase in difficulty. Additionally, we have added an extra feature to the game that is triggered when the ball is shot backwards.
